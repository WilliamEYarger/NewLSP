	COMMIT AND REVISE LOGIC
	There is a problem with the current version in that apparently a user control  
	contained  inside another user control can't call on its controls.
	1.	I will commit and push the current version BUT I WILL NOT MERGE IT WITH THE MASTER	
	2.	I will create an new branch from dev -> dev2
	3.	In dev2 I will incorporate all of the controls from the KeyWordControl into con
		controls on the Link_Note.xaml
	Commit Message: 1) Created NoteReferenceFile  code to store data relative to a Note. The
	NoteReferenceFile contains a) a descriptive name b) a hyperlink c) +/- a bookmark and 
	d) a string of ';' delimited key words; 2) Created a KeyWordControl user control to
	manage the input of keywords, but this contains a linking error to the holder usercontrol's
	controls.

2021 05 20	REVISED LOGIC OF KEYWORD SEARCH
	0.	NEW LOGIC - RESTRICT ALL KEYWORD COMPARISONS TO TWO ONLY
	1.	Keyword search will be fired when the user adds an entry that changes the text of the tbxAllKeyWords
		a.	*This will cause the btnSubmit "Search" button to become visable
		b.	*It will block the user from enterine new keywords and limit them to existing keywords
	2.	*All keywords will be entered by calling lbxKeyWords_MouseLeftButtonUp when the user
		selects an existing kehyword in the the lbxKewWords or by hitting the Enter key in the tbxInput text box. this occurs
		when the desired key word in at position 0 in lbxKeyWords or there is only one entry. If there
		are no entries in lbxKeyWords then the user will be sent a message informing them that the
		are limited to existing key words
	3.	*All selected keywords will show in tbxAllKeyWords
	4.	When the first KeyWord is entered, then all Notes containing that keywrod will be displayed
		and the Revert Key becomes available
	5.	If a new KeyWord is entered, then the intersection between the two will be displayed
		and the entry in the text in the tbxAllKeyWords will be changed to a KeyWord comparison,
		i.e. the combination of the first KeyWord, or KeyComparsion and the new KeyWord seperated
		by " + "
	6.	If the Revert button is clicked then the last KeyWord to be compared is removed
		and the former KeyCombination or the original KeyWord is displayed in tbxAllKeyWords
		and the References associated with them is displayed. Repeated pressing the Revert button
		can occur until there is nothing displayed in the tbxAllKeyWords or the lbxOpenSelectedNote

	TODO ITEMS EXPLANATION
	1.	TODO - 202105080750 Code Lookup NoteReferences containing the KeyWords Entered
		a. This will involve making  two string [] of the ';' deliited string of NoteReferenceID number names
			And then using Set theory Intersection  to determine the IDs found in both arrays.
		b.	It will also need to store 	NoteReferenceID number name of any note reference
			called for further inspection so that if the user wants to update its KeyWords string
			the program will know what Note to call for appending a KeyWord value. If a match
			is found then that

2021 05 07
	1.	*Notes References string SO NOT HAVE Note ID number in them. ???Do they need them???
		NO, they are needed for Keyword look ups and are supplied by the Key words dictionary, 
		but the NotesReferences file already contains all the notes linked to a DataNoteID,
		complete with hyperlinks
	2.	*Need to trim leading spaces in Keywords before adding them to the List of keywords
	3.	*When CREATING a new note, I need to add its NoteNjmericChars Name to all of its KeyWords
		in the dictionary
	4.	*Remove the Close button so the user can only close the application by clicking the menu opiton

  
2021 05 05
	1.	*Adjust code so that hitting Enter in the txbInput chooses the first item in lbxKeyWords if there
		are items already present but if not items are present, create a new KeyWord Item
	2.	*Change Terms to Key Words
		a.	*Change Open to Add. When KeyWordsStaticMembers.ListAccess is set to true you are in the
			mode of adding a Keyword to a new Note Reference
		b.	*When KeyWordsStaticMembers.ListAccess is set to false you are in the mode of searching
			for Notes who contain EXISTING KEYWORDS
	3.	*Create code for adding Key words and converted key words to both the active properts and to the 
		storage files


2021 05 04
	1.	When a notereference is created the following happens
		a.	a NoteReference file is created and named by the number of files in the NotesReferences folder
			It is a '^' deliited string containing :
			1)	An item Numeric character string which references a NoteReferenceFiles .txt file (ie 25^)
			2)	A NoteName (ie Docetism-Wikipeida^
			3)	A hyperline (ie https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetism^
			4)	+/-  a BookMark
			5)	a string of ';' delimited Keywords (ie Docetism;#Definition;Ignatius of Antioch;1 John;^)
		b.	In the CompositData folder a  KeyWords List  "ListOfKeyWords.txt"
			(
			 Dociticism,
			 Herasy,
			 Iraeneus,
			 Paul, St.
			 Peter, St.
			 etc.
			 )
		c.	For each keyword in ListOfKeyWords
			1)	All spaces are coverted to undersocres ie Paul, St. =  Paul,_St.
			2)	If the KeyWords Dictionary already contains a key on the underscoreKeyWords, then it 
				item's Numeric character string is appended to the '^' list of ItemNumberStrings 
				(i.e. ^2^13^25^)
			3)	Else a new dicionary item is added with the new  underscoreKeyWords as the Key
				and ^item Numeric character strin^ ( i.e. ^25^)
	2.	Folders and Files needed
		a.	*A User designated References folder (ie C:\Users\Owner\OneDrive\Documents\Learning\Religion\ReligionReferences)
		b.	Within the references folder a computer generated folder CompositData
			1)	*a Computer generated file NotesDictionary.txt to hold the delimited dicgtionay lines
			2)	*a Computer generated file ListOfKeyWords.txt to hold the keywords
			3)	*+/- a User Generated excel file Timeline file ReligionTimeline.xlsx
		c.	Within the references folder a computer generated folder NoteReferenceFiles

			string of KeyWords
		b.	*When the proto-note reference contains at least 1,2 and 4
			1)	Create a NoteReference string
		c.	*save the NoteReference to the NoteReferenceFiles folder and to the SubjectName\Notes folder

2021 04 24 0600 	LOGIC FOR NAMING, CREATING AND STORING NOTE REFERENCES AND NOTES
	1.	A Note Reference is a single line of double delimited text that contains:
		a.	A unique, and sequentially generated ID integer string
		b.	a Note Name
		c.	a Note Hyperlink
		d.	a delimited list of key words and content class names
			1)	a key word is one or more words that may include spaces. They will be indexed
				and will serve as keys in a Dictionary<string,string> whose value will be
				a delimited string of various ID integer strings that contain this key word(s).
				Althoug the user may enter the key words +/- caps and with spaces, befroe
				being converted into Dictionary Entries  with  dictionary keys they will be converted to all lower case
				and all spaces with be replaces with undersocres('_')
			2)	Content Class Names are terms preceeded with a '#'. they indicate that a 
				particular reference contains this kind of data. For example #lived, indicates
				that this particular reference contains the date that an indicidual lived,
				#occurred tells that a particular event occurred on a given date, #parents
				and #children says that the reference contains data abour a person's parents
				or progeny. Although Content Class Names will be displayed when a particular
				note name is selected, they WILL NOT BE INDEXED for includion in a dictionary.
				If date related Content Class Names are all in CAPS, i.e. #REIGNED, this means
				that these dates have been entered in a linkable excel Timeline worksheet.
	2.	Where Note References are stored and how they are naned
		1.	On startup the user will be asked to designate or creare a References folder.
			This folder will generally NOT reside in the same folder as a given subject,
			because often it will contain referens to related, but different subjects. 
			For example the References folder for the Bart Ehrman - The New Testament Notes and Questions
			Might reside under the Christianity, or Religion Learning folder because it will
			contain references to other data relative tothe sutdy of Christianity or other
			Religions. This References folder will contain two program generated folders
			"NoteReferenceFiles" and "CompositData"
			a.	The NoteReferenceFiles will contain text files whose name is generated from
				the current number of files in the NoteReferenceFiles folder (0.txt, 1.txt...n.txt etc.)
				Each file will contain one Note Reference as defined above.
			b.	The CompositData folder will always contain one Dictionary.txt file, where each line
				represents a Dictionary Entries as defined above
			c.	The CompositeData folder will also contain one Excel Timelin file, which the
				user can exect to add data to if the subject mater is historical
	3.	Where Notes are stored and how they are named.
		1.	The Notes, which are a collection of Note References all of which have been linked 
			to a particular DataNode ID will be in the "Subject Name"/Notes file and their
			name will be the DataNode ID + .txt
		2.	The user will be notified that a particular subject item has a Note file 
			when it is selected to be a DataNode
