	Committed VERSION20211213
	Commit Message 1) Removed Instructions from Link_Note; 2) Created controls and methods to allow the user to  display only
		the comments following a searched for KeyWord

20211215
	Working on VERSION20211213
	1.	Logic for the search function of the Link_Notes page
		a.	You should be able to search for notes containing a single Keyword even if you
			have not specified a DataNode
		b.	I need to identify all strings and list that are used to populate the various
			display components; make them properties in LinkNoteStaticMembers and use
			them rather than local private variables
	2.	??? used to populate the tbxAllKeyWords TextBox
		a.	If the programs is in the Add or Edit Mode, a local private variable CurrentKeyWords is defined 
			from the text in tbxAllKeyWords in the Add or Edit Mode and returns  ??? without using it??
	3.	The Edit radio button allows the user to edit the various components of the NoteReferenceFile 
		and save the Updated NoteReference string  Test to see if it works


		ERRORS!!! the  LinkNoteStaticMembers.HyperlinkDictionary is null????
		NOTE: Move node doesn't work


20211213
	VERSION20211213 0953 has successfully removed the Instructions from the Link_Note UC and has 
	modified the apperance of its UI to allow the user to display either all KeyWords and Comments

2021 06 11 BACKUP of dev2
1commit Message: ESTABLISHED NOTES: 1) In Main Subject folder created DataNodesNoteReferencesFiles folder to hold DataNode IntID.txt 
references to Referene Notes (NoteName^Reference Note Alpha26Name ie e.txt); 2) Enabled user to create a Common referece folder
to hold data applicable to more than 1 study folder 3) This Common reference folder contains : a. CompositData folder which contains::
i) KeyWordsDictionary.txt whose lines contains and converted key word (spaces teplaced by _) ^ and a ';' delimited list of
NoteReferenes containing that key word (i.e. Paul_the_Apostle^;A;C;); ii. ListOfKeyWords.txt file in which each line represents a key word, 
which may contain spaces (i.e. Paul the Apostle); b. A NoteReferenceFiles folder which contains NoteReferencde files each of which has 
an Alpha26 name (where A.txt is the first folder to be added and AA.txt is the 27th folder to be added), each of these files
contains a  delimited string containing: The Note Name, The note hyperlink, +/-a bookmark and a ';' delimited list of KeyWords 
(i.e. Paul the Apostle - Early Ministry^C:\Users\Owner\OneDrive\Documents\Learning\Religion\Christianity\Individuals\ApostolicAge\Paul the Apostle 
- Early Ministry.docx^^Paul the Apostle;Damascus;Ananias of Damascus;Jerusalem;Peter the Apostle;James the Just;)

		a.	*Yes there should be a terminal ' ;' but I have lost it somewhere in the earlier code
			Check editing an existing note CORRECTED
I CANNOT ADD A NEW NOTE TO A SUBJECT THAT ALREADY HAS A NOTE

2021 06 05 NEW NOTES
	0.	FILE NAME CHANGES
		a.	*Make sere every Subect folder contains a DataNodesNoteReferencesFiles folder
		b.	Make sure that every time a key word is added that the ListOfKeyWords.txt file is updated
	1.	What is a note? A Note is a docx, txt, xls, jpg, http or some other type of address
		containing data about a named subject.
	2.	What is a NoteReference file? A Note reference file contains:
		a.	a descriptive NoteName (eg Jerusalem Council - Wikipedia)
		b.	an hyperlink (eg C:\Users\Owner\OneDrive\Documents\Learning\Religion\Christianity\Events\Jerusalem Council Wikipedia.docx)
		c.	possible a BookMark (eg Issues and outcome)
		d.	a ';' delimited list of KeyWords (eg Ecumenical Councils; Paul the Apostle; Simon Peter; James the Just;etc)
			A Note Reference file is storred in a central designated combined references folder (eg 
		C:\Users\Owner\OneDrive\Documents\Learning\Religion\ReligionReferences\NoteReferenceFiles
		or C:\Users\Owner\OneDrive\Documents\_StudyFolder\S1References\NoteReferenceFiles
			Its name is the Alpha equivalent of a base 26 number representing the current
		number of files storred in the designated references folder. (For example, if the
		folder C:\Users\Owner\OneDrive\Documents\_StudyFolder\S1References\NoteReferenceFiles has 0 files when
		a new Reference file is created its name would be A.txt, if it had 26 files, its name would be AA.txt etc.)
	3.	What is a DataNodesNoteReferences file? It is a .txt file whose name is the data nodes integer ID character converted
		to a string (eg 4.txt). Each line of the file contains a NoteReference file name ( eg "Jerusalem Council - Wikipedia")
		and an AlphaCharNumberBased name of a particular NoteReference file (eg AA.txt) delimited with a '^'. For example
		if a DataNode (for example Eccumenical Councils {ID = 235})had references to notes about: 1) the Jerusalem Council of 50 CE,
		2) St Paul, 3) St Peter, 4) St James the Just, 5) Christology, 6) Ethics and 7)Gentiles it might look something like this
			Paul the Apostle^C
			Simon Peter^A
			James the Just^G
			Christology ^AR	
			Ethics^BC
			Gentiles^K
		The path of this file might be C:\Users\Owner\OneDrive\Documents\Learning\Religion\ReligionReferences\NoteReferenceFiles\235.txt
	4.	What happens when the user designates a subject node as the DataNode? 
		a.	The Subject's DataNodesNoteReferencesFiles folder is queried to see if there is file whose
			name is the DataNodes ID to string number (eg 4.txt)
		b.	If Yes the Note Symbol is highlighted
	5.	What happens when the user selects the Links-Notes Page
		a)	if there is a linked file in the DataNodesNoteReferencesFiles folder then:
			1)	its content is read into the lbxOpenSelectedNote listbox when the page opens
			2)	then Link_Note.xaml.cx variable private string CurrentNoteReferenceFileName is set to ""
	6.	What happens when the user LeftClicks the lbxOpenSelectedNote list box
		a.	The Selected Item text value is used to extract the NoteReference file name (ef T for T.txt in the
			NoteReference file)
		b.	The File is Opened and its content is copied to the various fields
		c.	The Edit Radiobutton is checked
		d.	The  NoteReference file name is copied to the  CurrentNoteReferenceFileName
	7.	What happens when the User RightClicks the lbxOpenSelectedNote list box
		a.	The Selected Item text value is used to extract the NoteReference file name (ef T for T.txt in the
			NoteReference file)
		b.	The File is Opened and its key words are copied to the tbxDisplayKeyWords
	8.	What happens if the user clicks the Save Note Reference
		a.	The format of all of the elements is checked to make sure they are correct and if it proceeds to
		b.	Checks to see if CurrentNoteReferenceFileName == ""
			1)	If True then the number of the files in the central designated combined references folder is
				used to create a new Base26 AlphaChar name for the file to be saved and all
				of the elements are written to that file
			2)	If False (that means this is an existing note) then the KeyWords overwrite those
				of the existing file
		c.	The Note Name and the CurrentNoteReferenceFileName is Added to the lbxOpenSelectedNote list box


 
2021 05 29 
	1.	Creat new method for creating a note
		a.	Use the File Dialog to open a note file, this can be
			a docx, web, txt ...etc file
			1)	Place its path or url in the tbxHyperlink
		b.	Create a Name and a Bookmark, if needed
		c.	Add KeyWords
	2.	When saving a note
		a.	Create the NoteReferenceFile
			1)	Get its IDName from the number of entries in the NoteReferenesFiles folder
			2)	Create the Note. It fields are: IDName^NoteName^Hyperlink^BookMark^KeyWords(';' delimited)
			3)	Save the NotereferenceFile to the  NoteReferenesFiles folder
		b.	Look to see if a NoteNamesIDs file exists (Its name is the DataNodesID intchar + .txt)
			1)	If not, creaet if and appende the NoteName and the NoteReferenceFile ID Char (ie Arianism^D)
			2)	Is so, appende the NoteName and the NoteReferenceFile ID Char (ie Arianism^5)

2021 05 28
	Currently Notes are a collections of NoteReferences, so that the data are
	duplicated in a NoteReference and a Note. My new concept is that
	a Note ought to be a list of note Names and IntegerChar refering to the NoteReference Name i.e. 
		Wikipedia - Jerusalem Council^4
		Jerusalem Council^0
	1.	*Change the folder Notes to NoteNamesIDs
	2.	When a DataNode is selected
		a.	a DictionaryOfNoteNamesIDs<string,string> will be created where the Key is the IDIntChar
			and the value is the NoteName^IDIntChar
	2.	When a user creates a new Note to be added to the	
		DataNode's NoteNamesIDs file file
		a.	The NoteReference file will contain: IDIntChar^NoteName^Hyperlink^BookMark^';'DelimitedKeyWords
		b.	The NoteNamesIDs for the DataNode will have a line of NoteName^IDIntChar appended to it
	3.	When the ShowNotes is clicked
		a.	All of the lines in the DictionaryOfNoteNamesIDs file will show
	4.	When the user selects a line in the lbxOpenSelectedNote to open a note
		a.	The IDIntChar will be extracted
		b.	It will be used to Open the appropriate NoteReference file and
			place its items in the correct fields and the Note will be opened
	5.	When the user selects a line in the lbxOpenSelectedNote to show associated KeyWords
		a.	The IDIntChar will be extracted
		b.	It will be used to Open the appropriate NoteReference file and the
			Key words will be displayed in tbxDisplayKeyWords

2021 05 26
	1.	Hyperlinks workd OK
	2.	What do I want to happen when the user clicks a note name in the lbxOpenSelectedNote?
		a.	List the Note name in the tbxLinkName
		b.	List the hyperlink in the tbxHyperlink
		c.	List the bookmark in the tbxBookMark
		d.	Set rbtEdit IsChecked to true
		e.	Enter the KeyWords in tbxAllKeyWords
	3	What has to happen first? I need all of the values for the selected note
	3.	?SelectedNoteReferenceValuesDictionary has not been defined
		a.	What should it contain?
				Create a Dictionary<int, string> SelectedNoteReferenceValues, in which
                a)	The Key will be an integer from 0 to Number of referecnes containing that key-1 and
                b)	The Value will be the '^' delimited string of the selected NoteReferenceFile


2021 05 22 0758 DEVELOPEMNT OF DEV2
	1.	Determine size of KeyWordControl and allocate space for it in Link_Note.xaml = 150x1200
		a.	*In Link-Note.xaml create a border of size 150x1200 with width = 1 black
		b.	*Copy all controls from KeyWordControl.xaml to a Grid in the border
		c.	*Copy all methods from KeyWordControl.xaml.cs to Link_Note.xaml.cs
	2.	*For the initial version of KeyWord search I will limit the user to 1 Key word
		a.	*When a keyword is entered create and call a method to ReturnNoteNameList, which will:
			1)	*Create a Dictionary<int,string> SelectedNoteReferenceValues, in which 
				a)	*The Key will be an integer from 0 to Number of referecnes containing that key-1 and
				b)	*The Value will be the '^' delimited string of the selected NoteReferenceFile
			2)	*the ReturnNoteNameList method will then return a List<string> of NoteReferenceNames from  the
				NoteName fields (position 0 in the '^' delimited string of the selected NoteReferenceFile)
				of the selected Note References 
			3)	*The Link_note.xaml.cs  file will display this list in the lbxOpenSelectedNote list box
	3.	*Create the code to display the associated KeyWords when a NoteName in the lbxOpenSelectedNote is Right Clicked	
	4.	*Create a common  int variable CurrentNoteIDInt and set its base value to -1
	5.	Get the NoteName ID of the selected note
		a.	*In KeyWordsStaticMembers create a Dictionary<int,int> DictionaryOfNoteRefSPosAndNoteIDs where the Key is the sequential value
			from 0 to the Number of Notes containing that key -1; and the value is the NoteNameID converted 
			to an int
		b.	*Fill it is when the NoteNames of a KeyWord is processed
	6	Create the code to open the Note when the Note name is left clicked
		a.	When a NoteName is LeftClicked
			1)	Clear all fields in the KeyWord section
			2)	Set the rbtAdd to clicked 
			3)	When a NoteName has been selected for opening change the
				value of  CurrentNoteIDInt to the value of the NoteName (ie. 7.txt  =  7)
			4)	Copy the note name, the hyperlink, the bookmark, and the key words to their appropriate fields
				in the upper screen
			5)	Copy any book mark to the clip board and open the hyperlink
	7.	Alter the SaveNote menu item's code to depend on the value of CurrentNoteIDInt
		a.	If it is -1, then this is a new note and the note is saved to the value of the number of files in the
			NoteReferenceFiles folder
		b.	Otherwise this is a edited note and save all of the values to the Note whose name is
			CurrentNoteIDInt.txt
	8.	Because the tbxAllKeyWords has 3 uses: Creting a note, searching for a KeyWord and Editing a keyWord
		I will need 3 radion buttons
		a.	Add rbEdit "Edit"



2021 05 22 Committed at 0753
	COMMIT AND REVISE LOGIC
	There is a problem with the current version in that apparently a user control  
	contained  inside another user control can't call on its controls.
	1.	I will commit and push the current version BUT I WILL NOT MERGE IT WITH THE MASTER	
	2.	I will create an new branch from dev -> dev2
	3.	In dev2 I will incorporate all of the controls from the KeyWordControl into con
		controls on the Link_Note.xaml
	Commit Message: 1) Created NoteReferenceFile  code to store data relative to a Note. The
	NoteReferenceFile contains a) a descriptive name b) a hyperlink c) +/- a bookmark and 
	d) a string of ';' delimited key words; 2) Created a KeyWordControl user control to
	manage the input of keywords, but this contains a linking error to the holder usercontrol's
	controls.

2021 05 20	REVISED LOGIC OF KEYWORD SEARCH
	0.	NEW LOGIC - RESTRICT ALL KEYWORD COMPARISONS TO TWO ONLY
	1.	Keyword search will be fired when the user adds an entry that changes the text of the tbxAllKeyWords
		a.	*This will cause the btnSubmit "Search" button to become visable
		b.	*It will block the user from enterine new keywords and limit them to existing keywords
	2.	*All keywords will be entered by calling lbxKeyWords_MouseLeftButtonUp when the user
		selects an existing kehyword in the the lbxKewWords or by hitting the Enter key in the tbxInput text box. this occurs
		when the desired key word in at position 0 in lbxKeyWords or there is only one entry. If there
		are no entries in lbxKeyWords then the user will be sent a message informing them that the
		are limited to existing key words
	3.	*All selected keywords will show in tbxAllKeyWords
	4.	When the first KeyWord is entered, then all Notes containing that keywrod will be displayed
		and the Revert Key becomes available
	5.	If a new KeyWord is entered, then the intersection between the two will be displayed
		and the entry in the text in the tbxAllKeyWords will be changed to a KeyWord comparison,
		i.e. the combination of the first KeyWord, or KeyComparsion and the new KeyWord seperated
		by " + "
	6.	If the Revert button is clicked then the last KeyWord to be compared is removed
		and the former KeyCombination or the original KeyWord is displayed in tbxAllKeyWords
		and the References associated with them is displayed. Repeated pressing the Revert button
		can occur until there is nothing displayed in the tbxAllKeyWords or the lbxOpenSelectedNote
	


2021 05 08 
	TODO ITEMS EXPLANATION
	1.	TODO - 202105080750 Code Lookup NoteReferences containing the KeyWords Entered
		a. This will involve making  two string [] of the ';' deliited string of NoteReferenceID number names
			And then using Set theory Intersection  to determine the IDs found in both arrays.
		b.	It will also need to store 	NoteReferenceID number name of any note reference
			called for further inspection so that if the user wants to update its KeyWords string
			the program will know what Note to call for appending a KeyWord value. If a match
			is found then that

2021 05 07
	1.	*Notes References string SO NOT HAVE Note ID number in them. ???Do they need them???
		NO, they are needed for Keyword look ups and are supplied by the Key words dictionary, 
		but the NotesReferences file already contains all the notes linked to a DataNoteID,
		complete with hyperlinks
	2.	*Need to trim leading spaces in Keywords before adding them to the List of keywords
	3.	*When CREATING a new note, I need to add its NoteNjmericChars Name to all of its KeyWords
		in the dictionary
	4.	*Remove the Close button so the user can only close the application by clicking the menu opiton

  
2021 05 05
	1.	*Adjust code so that hitting Enter in the txbInput chooses the first item in lbxKeyWords if there
		are items already present but if not items are present, create a new KeyWord Item
	2.	*Change Terms to Key Words
		a.	*Change Open to Add. When KeyWordsStaticMembers.ListAccess is set to true you are in the
			mode of adding a Keyword to a new Note Reference
		b.	*When KeyWordsStaticMembers.ListAccess is set to false you are in the mode of searching
			for Notes who contain EXISTING KEYWORDS
	3.	*Create code for adding Key words and converted key words to both the active properts and to the 
		storage files


2021 05 04
	1.	When a notereference is created the following happens
		a.	a NoteReference file is created and named by the number of files in the NotesReferences folder
			It is a '^' deliited string containing :
			1)	An item Numeric character string which references a NoteReferenceFiles .txt file (ie 25^)
			2)	A NoteName (ie Docetism-Wikipeida^
			3)	A hyperline (ie https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetism^
			4)	+/-  a BookMark
			5)	a string of ';' delimited Keywords (ie Docetism;#Definition;Ignatius of Antioch;1 John;^)
		b.	In the CompositData folder a  KeyWords List  "ListOfKeyWords.txt"
			(
			 Dociticism,
			 Herasy,
			 Iraeneus,
			 Paul, St.
			 Peter, St.
			 etc.
			 )
		c.	For each keyword in ListOfKeyWords
			1)	All spaces are coverted to undersocres ie Paul, St. =  Paul,_St.
			2)	If the KeyWords Dictionary already contains a key on the underscoreKeyWords, then it 
				item's Numeric character string is appended to the '^' list of ItemNumberStrings 
				(i.e. ^2^13^25^)
			3)	Else a new dicionary item is added with the new  underscoreKeyWords as the Key
				and ^item Numeric character strin^ ( i.e. ^25^)
	2.	Folders and Files needed
		a.	*A User designated References folder (ie C:\Users\Owner\OneDrive\Documents\Learning\Religion\ReligionReferences)
		b.	Within the references folder a computer generated folder CompositData
			1)	*a Computer generated file NotesDictionary.txt to hold the delimited dicgtionay lines
			2)	*a Computer generated file ListOfKeyWords.txt to hold the keywords
			3)	*+/- a User Generated excel file Timeline file ReligionTimeline.xlsx
		c.	Within the references folder a computer generated folder NoteReferenceFiles

			1) *In Common static create a bool to indicate that the DataNode has a note file
			2)	*Set this to true when the node has a note
		d.	In LinkNotes xaml create menuitem to open notes file


		c.	When the user left clicks on a Note Name, transmit the selected index to static
			and display the hyperlink and Book mark in the appropriate text boxes, 
			write the bookmark to the Clipboard and use System.Diagnostics.Process.Start 
			to open the hyperlink
		d.	When the user Right clicks on a Note name send the selected index to static
			which returns  a List<string> of the delimited Key words
			which are displayed seriatim in tbxDisplayKeyWords
	2.	CREATE A COMMON STATIC AREA TO HOLD ALL PATHS AND COMMON PROPERITES

2021 04 24 0700 TASKS
	1.	*Code requirement forcing the user to create or choose a References folder on startup
		a.	*create a message telling the user to create a references folder
		b.	*open file CommonOpenFileDialog 
		c.	*create "NoteReferenceFiles" and "CompositData" folders
		d.	*In SubjectStaticMembers create properties to hold "NoteReferenceFiles" and "CompositData" folder paths
		e.	*In the CompositData folder create a NotesDictionary.txt file
		f.	*If the user wants to have a timeline they will have to add it manually
		g.	*In SubjectStaticMembers create properties to hold NotesDictionary.txt and the Timeline path
	2.	*Creating a NoteReference 
		a.	*A  NoteReference contains a '^' delimited string containing : 1) A Note Name; 2) a hyperlink; 3) +/-  a bookmark; 4) a ';' delimited 
			string of KeyWords
		b.	*When the proto-note reference contains at least 1,2 and 4
			1)	Create a NoteReference string
		c.	*save the NoteReference to the NoteReferenceFiles folder and to the SubjectName\Notes folder

2021 04 24 0600 	LOGIC FOR NAMING, CREATING AND STORING NOTE REFERENCES AND NOTES
	1.	A Note Reference is a single line of double delimited text that contains:
		a.	A unique, and sequentially generated ID integer string
		b.	a Note Name
		c.	a Note Hyperlink
		d.	a delimited list of key words and content class names
			1)	a key word is one or more words that may include spaces. They will be indexed
				and will serve as keys in a Dictionary<string,string> whose value will be
				a delimited string of various ID integer strings that contain this key word(s).
				Althoug the user may enter the key words +/- caps and with spaces, befroe
				being converted into Dictionary Entries  with  dictionary keys they will be converted to all lower case
				and all spaces with be replaces with undersocres('_')
			2)	Content Class Names are terms preceeded with a '#'. they indicate that a 
				particular reference contains this kind of data. For example #lived, indicates
				that this particular reference contains the date that an indicidual lived,
				#occurred tells that a particular event occurred on a given date, #parents
				and #children says that the reference contains data abour a person's parents
				or progeny. Although Content Class Names will be displayed when a particular
				note name is selected, they WILL NOT BE INDEXED for includion in a dictionary.
				If date related Content Class Names are all in CAPS, i.e. #REIGNED, this means
				that these dates have been entered in a linkable excel Timeline worksheet.
	2.	Where Note References are stored and how they are naned
		1.	On startup the user will be asked to designate or creare a References folder.
			This folder will generally NOT reside in the same folder as a given subject,
			because often it will contain referens to related, but different subjects. 
			For example the References folder for the Bart Ehrman - The New Testament Notes and Questions
			Might reside under the Christianity, or Religion Learning folder because it will
			contain references to other data relative tothe sutdy of Christianity or other
			Religions. This References folder will contain two program generated folders
			"NoteReferenceFiles" and "CompositData"
			a.	The NoteReferenceFiles will contain text files whose name is generated from
				the current number of files in the NoteReferenceFiles folder (0.txt, 1.txt...n.txt etc.)
				Each file will contain one Note Reference as defined above.
			b.	The CompositData folder will always contain one Dictionary.txt file, where each line
				represents a Dictionary Entries as defined above
			c.	The CompositeData folder will also contain one Excel Timelin file, which the
				user can exect to add data to if the subject mater is historical
	3.	Where Notes are stored and how they are named.
		1.	The Notes, which are a collection of Note References all of which have been linked 
			to a particular DataNode ID will be in the "Subject Name"/Notes file and their
			name will be the DataNode ID + .txt
		2.	The user will be notified that a particular subject item has a Note file 
			when it is selected to be a DataNode
